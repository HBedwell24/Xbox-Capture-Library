# Xbox Capture Library
A WPF Windows Application written in ASP.NET, which is purposed with pulling and displaying a user's videos/screenshots from Xbox Live using the "X" API service. Of the features implemented, all end users are granted the ability of:
* Filtering displayed captures by various search parameter metrics, including capture duration, like amount, view amount, etc.
* Displaying detailed statistics on a selected capture of choice (i.e. number of likes, the device on which the capture was taken, etc.).
* Downloading a capture in MP4 or PNG format respectively (depending on the capture type).
* Adjusting the application theme to more adequately compensate for light indifferences in the immediate vicinity.
